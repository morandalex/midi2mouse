# midi 2 software automation

The idea behind this project is to connect  the midi signal  with the mouse or keyboard control using Nodejs

In this sense , we can control every software.

I think that the most famous use case is try to use midi controls with film making software, in example Davinci Resolve.

If you think that the effort is worth it , please consider to contribute or you want to, feel free to do it at Buy-Me- A-Coffee â˜•, I will be really thankfull for anything even if it is a coffee or just a kind comment towards my work.

## Requirements

## Setup installation

Open a terminal and :

    git clone https://github.com/morandalex/midi2mouse.git

Then open the globalvar.env file, and write the path of the folder where you are the midi2mouse modules.
In that sense you can use the library in a different OS.
