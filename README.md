# midi2mouse

The idea behind this project is to connect  the midi signal  with the mouse or keyboard control using Nodejs

In this sense , we can control every software.

I think that the most famous use case is try to use midi controls with film making software, in example Davinci Resolve.

If you think that the effort is worth it , please consider to contribute or you want to, feel free to do it at Buy-Me- A-Coffee â˜•, I will be really thankfull for anything even if it is a coffee or just a kind comment towards my work.
